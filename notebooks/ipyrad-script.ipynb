    "I first will run the ACAGTG pool raw reads from three lanes. But since the same pools were run across three different lanes, I will need to run each pool of each lane separately and then concatenate them. The barcodes file for this test run includes all the sample names and their associated P1 barcodes in the ACAGTG pool. I will run each of the three lanes of my remaining five pools the same way I run it for the ACAGTG pool. For the rest of the PDSB project, however, I will only use samples from the Wickecheoke. This is mostly to save on processing time. "
