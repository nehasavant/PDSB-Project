Tutorials for running ipyrad and EEMS are currently in the project folder. The most useful way to use these is to open these files and follow them on GitHub.  Later, I plan to upload a subset of the data files onto GitHub so you will be able to download the tutorial notebooks onto your local computer and execute the code using my example data. 

Read this page if you need to install [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
